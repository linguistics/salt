If you log into EasyChair and appear to have only the role of &quot;author&quot;, the email address associated with your reviewer identity is most likely different from the one you&#x27;re currently logged in with. To determine what email address EasyChair associated with your reviewer identity, look at the &quot;To:&quot; field of an email notification you&#x27;ve received from EasyChair.<br/>To resolve this issue you can either log out and then log back in with the email address associated with your reviewer account, or follow the steps below to link your primary account with the other email address:<ol><li>Login to EasyChair with your usual account and find the &quot;My account&quot; link in the dropdown menu under &quot;EasyChair&quot;</li><li>In the &quot;Email Addresses&quot; section, add a &quot;New alternative address&quot; with the <i>exact</i> email address that a (reviewing-related) EasyChair notification was sent to.</li><li>EasyChair will send an email to that address to confirm that you have access to that account.</li><li>Open that email and click the URL to confirm, which should take you back to the EasyChair site.</li></ol>In rarer cases, you may have two distinct EasyChair accounts, and it won&#x27;t allow you add an &quot;alternative address.&quot; In that case, you have to &quot;merge&quot; the two accounts. Go to &quot;My account&quot; under the &quot;EasyChair&quot; dropdown in the main horizontal navigation bar. At the bottom of that page there is a &quot;Merge accounts&quot; section that will merge the other account into your current account.</section></div><div class="drop"><div class="punctuation-huge">〉</div></div></div></body></html>
