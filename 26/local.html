  <h3>DoubleTree</h3>
  <p>
    We have reserved a block of 30 rooms at the <a href="http://doubletree.hilton.com/en/dt/groups/personalized/A/AUSFLDT-SLT-20160511/index.jhtml?WT.mc_id=POG">DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel</a>, for the dates of May 11 (check-in) through May 16 (check-out).
    The address is <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/DoubleTree+Suites+by+Hilton+Hotel+Austin,+303+W+15th+St,+Austin,+TX+78701">303 W 15th St, Austin, TX 78701</a> (the corner of 15th and Lavaca), which is about half a mile from where most of SALT will take place.
  </p>

  <p>You can also make a reservation over the phone; call 800-222-8733 and mention the group code "SLT".</p>

  <p>If you reserve a room at the DoubleTree Suites, or plan to, please let us know via email (<a href="mailto:salt26conf@gmail.com">salt26conf@gmail.com</a>) so that, if demand exceeds our expectations, we can request more rooms to be added to the block.</p>

  <h3>Food</h3>
  <p>
    For now, please see the <a href="http://nasslli2012.com/food">NASSLLI 2012 - Food</a> page for a listing of restaurants / caf√©s near campus.
    (I'll try to do a full update before SALT starts.)

  <p>
    Most of the places on the NASSLLI page are still there, but I would recommend checking <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=78712">Yelp!</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/Restaurants+near+78712">Google Maps</a> before venturing out.
