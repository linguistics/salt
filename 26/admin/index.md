## Abstract submission and review process

### Topics

We provided the option of selecting multiple topics out of the following list:

* Acquisition of meaning
* Anaphora and ellipsis
* Attitudes & intentionality
* Comparatives and superlatives
* Compositionality
* Computational semantics
* Conditionals
* Conjunction and/or disjunction
* Corpus-based semantics
* Definiteness, indefiniteness and specificity
* Diachronic semantics
* Dialogue semantics
* Discourse structure
* Dynamic Semantics & DRT
* Evidentiality
* Exclusives and additives
* Exhaustivity and maximality
* Existential constructions
* Experimental semantics and pragmatics
* Field-based semantics and semantics of underrepresented languages
* Genericity and kinds
* History of semantics and pragmatics
* Imperatives
* Implicature
* Indexicality and deixis
* Information Structure
* Lexical Semantics, thematic structure
* Mereology
* Modality
* Modifiers (adjectives, adverbs)
* Plurality and distributivity
* Polarity / Negation
* Possessives
* Quantification and scope
* Questions and interrogatives
* Quotation
* Scalarity, degree semantics
* Semantics of signed language
* Semantic processing
* Social meaning
* Speech acts and performativity
* Temporality (Tense, aspect)
* Typology and variation
* Vagueness and gradability

"Semantics of signed language" was added on 2015-12-01.

We considered "Neurolinguistic semantics" as a topic, but decided it wasn't enough of a thing except in the non-linguistic context of neuro-linguistic programming.


### Special session topics

For the special session on presupposition, we offered the following topics in a subsequent section:

* Anaphoric presupposition
* Corpus approaches to presupposition
* Cross-linguistic approaches to presupposition
* Definiteness presuppositions
* Diagnostics for presupposition
* Experimental approaches to presupposition
* Factive presuppositions
* Logics of presupposition
* Pragmatic presupposition
* Presupposition & conventional implicature
* Presupposition & focus
* Presupposition & quantification
* Presupposition accommodation
* Presupposition projection
* Presuppositional scales (Maximize presupposition)
* Variation between presupposition triggers (e.g. hard vs. soft)

### Misc. Comments / Advice

* Even if all the relevant information is online, or in an email, people love printouts. Here's some of the stuff we printed and made available at the registration desk:
  - Wi-fi access information
  - Public URL to shared Box.com folder
  - Campus map with relevant buildings & nearby parking highlighted
  - Full program on single page, 2-up and double-sided (it was handy to have a print-friendly program on the website for this purpose)
* Deadlines:
  - Even if there is no hard deadline, practically, make one up. People love deadlines.
  - If you want to receive an email by the time X rolls around, choose your wording carefully. "Email it to us before X" seems to confuse some people. "Email it to us by (X-1)" or "Email it to us. Deadline: (X-1)" works better.
  - Depending on the purpose, a lot of people will be late. Box.com's "Email to upload" feature is really handy, so that you don't have to worry about transferring last-minute email attachments to the presentation console.
  - If you can figure out a way to say "even if you miss the deadline, send it along anyway and we can probably still make it work" without softening the sense of deadline, that might allay some time-consuming questions.
* Despite having recently entered the 21st century, A/V is still finicky.
  - Have a dedicated laptop for presentation purposes
    + Have it plugged in, so that it can just sit there all day
    + This also helps ensure there are no time-wasting scrambles to find the appropriate video adapter or power sources
    + Strongly suggest that all presenters submit their slides beforehand. See above about deadlines and Box.com.
  - Sync a Dropbox / Box.com folder on that machine. The cloud / web is a far more trustworthy and fluid information transmission device than any presentation setup (as long as you have wi-fi).
