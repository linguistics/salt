## Abstract submission and review process

### Topics

We provided the option of selecting multiple topics out of the following list:

* Acquisition of meaning
* Anaphora and ellipsis
* Attitudes & intentionality
* Comparatives and superlatives
* Compositionality
* Computational semantics
* Conditionals
* Conjunction and/or disjunction
* Corpus-based semantics
* Definiteness, indefiniteness and specificity
* Diachronic semantics
* Dialogue semantics
* Discourse structure
* Dynamic Semantics & DRT
* Evidentiality
* Exclusives and additives
* Exhaustivity and maximality
* Existential constructions
* Experimental semantics and pragmatics
* Field-based semantics and semantics of underrepresented languages
* Genericity and kinds
* History of semantics and pragmatics
* Imperatives
* Implicature
* Indexicality and deixis
* Information Structure
* Lexical Semantics, thematic structure
* Mereology
* Modality
* Modifiers (adjectives, adverbs)
* Plurality and distributivity
* Polarity / Negation
* Possessives
* Quantification and scope
* Questions and interrogatives
* Quotation
* Scalarity, degree semantics
* Semantics of signed language
* Semantic processing
* Social meaning
* Speech acts and performativity
* Temporality (Tense, aspect)
* Typology and variation
* Vagueness and gradability

"Semantics of signed language" was added on 2015-12-01.

We considered "Neurolinguistic semantics" as a topic, but decided it wasn't enough of a thing except in the non-linguistic context of neuro-linguistic programming.


### Special session topics

For the special session on presupposition, we offered the following topics in a subsequent section:

* Anaphoric presupposition
* Corpus approaches to presupposition
* Cross-linguistic approaches to presupposition
* Definiteness presuppositions
* Diagnostics for presupposition
* Experimental approaches to presupposition
* Factive presuppositions
* Logics of presupposition
* Pragmatic presupposition
* Presupposition & conventional implicature
* Presupposition & focus
* Presupposition & quantification
* Presupposition accommodation
* Presupposition projection
* Presuppositional scales (Maximize presupposition)
* Variation between presupposition triggers (e.g. hard vs. soft)
