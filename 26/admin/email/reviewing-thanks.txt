Dear SALT reviewers,

We're writing to thank you for all the work you put into reviewing for SALT 26 at the University of Texas in 2016. We could not possibly have done it without you, and we were really happy with the resulting program --- everyone we've talked to felt that, yet again, it was very strong.

To help future SALT instantiations instantiate, we are running a 10 minute survey collecting opinions from reviewers, presenters, and other attendees. We'd be very grateful if you could provide your feedback at the following link:

(If you already received the link and took the survey as a presenter/attendee, you don't need to take it again!)

All the best,

The UT SALT crew (*Signature*)
