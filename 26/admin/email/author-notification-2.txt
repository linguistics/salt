Subject: SALT 26 author response period reminder; additional reviews in some cases

Dear [*FIRST-NAME*],

This is primarily a reminder that the author response period is drawing to an end, and the response form will be disabled on Friday, January 29th, at 11:59 PM CST. At that point, reviewers will have the opportunity to read your response and modify their reviews. The committee's final decisions (to be sent out by the end of February) will also include all of these reviews, along with the revisions, if there are any.

For most authors, the list of reviews below (for submission [*NUMBER*]) is a repeat of the list you received last weekend. But for a few authors, it will contain one or two new reviews, since we had a few late reviews sent in, which obviously were not included in the original notification email that was sent out on January 23rd. While these were available on EasyChair as soon as the reviewer submitted them, I realize that it might have been unclear that more reviews were potentially forthcoming, since for the most part, the original notification included all of the (then-)relevant information.

Best,

*Signature*, on behalf of the SALT organizing committee
