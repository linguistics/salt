Subject: SALT 26 review reminder

Dear [*FIRST-NAME*],

I noticed that with 72 hours to go, you still haven't submitted any of your SALT reviews. Please can you let me know if there's any problem?

If you're having difficulty with the EasyChair system, we can send you
the abstract PDFs and an online (non-EasyChair) form to fill out with your reviews.

Sorry for getting nervous about this, but we're on a tight timeline, given that we have to get decisions out in time for people to make (possibly international) flight arrangements.

Best,

*Signature*
