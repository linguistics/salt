Subject: SALT 26 - Invitation to review

Dear {first_name:s},

<p>I'm writing to request your help with reviewing abstracts for Semantics and
Linguistic Theory 26, to be held at the University of Texas at Austin, May 12-15, 2016
(http://salt.ling.utexas.edu/26/). Abstracts are due on December 20, 2015.
We will send out reviewing assignments by December 23, 2015, via EasyChair,
and reviews will be due on January 22, 2016.

<p><b>If you're able to take this on, please confirm with an email reply; a quick "yes" suffices!</b>
You can also use this address (<a href="mailto:salt26conf@gmail.com">salt26conf@gmail.com</a>)
for any other queries you might have.

<p>After we receive a confirmation, you will receive a further email from EasyChair with a link
to our conference's <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=salt26">review site</a>.
Once you've logged in to EasyChair, click "My topics" under the "SALT 26" tab, and there you will be able
to select topics of interest for abstracts you will be assigned to review.
There is a section of topics dedicated to our special session on presupposition.
Please select any topics you would be happy to review for in the special session,
as well as any topics you would like to review for in the main session.
(There is overlap between special and main session topics;
please select in both places if you're willing to review for both sessions.)
Regardless of how many topics you select, you will be assigned no more than six abstracts,
each at most three pages of main text.

<p>Reviewers are strongly encouraged to <a href="http://salt.ling.utexas.edu/26/call">submit
their own abstracts</a> as well.

<p>Thank you for helping make SALT 26 a success, and I look forward to welcoming you to UT Austin in May!

<p>Sincerely,
<br>
*Signature*, on behalf of the SALT 26 Organizing Committee

<p>P.S. If you would prefer not to receive further SALT-related announcements at this address,
please reply to this email with the subject <b>UNSUBSCRIBE</b>.
