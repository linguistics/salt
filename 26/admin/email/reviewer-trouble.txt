Subject: SALT 26 - Reviewing (are you OK?)

Dear {Firstname:s},

<p>I noticed that you haven't logged into EasyChair yet.
Since reviews are due in just 3 days (Friday, January 22), please can you let me know
as soon as possible if there's a problem, and if there's anything I can do to get you up and running?</p>

<p>If you're having difficulty logging on to the EasyChair system, we can send you
the abstract PDFs and an online (non-EasyChair) form to fill out with your reviews.
</p>

<p>Sincerely,
<br>
*Signature*, on behalf of the SALT 26 Organizing Committee
