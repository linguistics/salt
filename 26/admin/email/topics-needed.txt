Subject: SALT 26 - reviewing assignments - topics needed!

Dear [*FIRST-NAME*],

We on the organizing committee are planning to meet on Monday, Dec. 21, to assign abstracts to reviewers. We are primarily going to be using topic alignments between reviewers and abstracts to make assignments, and it appears that you have not yet selected any topics on EasyChair.

To ensure that we are able to assign you relevant abstracts, please sign on to the SALT 26 EasyChair page and select your topics of interest before Monday morning. The original instructions follow:

Once you've logged in to EasyChair, click "My topics" under the "SALT 26" tab, and there you will be able to select topics of interest for abstracts you will be assigned to review. There is a section of topics dedicated to our special session on presupposition. Please select any topics you would be happy to review for in the special session, as well as any topics you would like to review for in the main session. (There is overlap between special and main session topics; please select in both places if you're willing to review for both sessions.) Regardless of how many topics you select, you will be assigned no more than six abstracts, each at most three pages of main text.

You have PC ("program committee") access to the SALT 26 EasyChair site, and should be able to logon (with the email address that this email is sent to) at this URL: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=salt26

If you have any trouble logging on or selecting topics, please let us know, at salt26conf@gmail.com, or just reply to this email.

On behalf of the SALT 26 organizing committee
