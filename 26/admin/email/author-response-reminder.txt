Subject: Upcoming author response period (January 23-29)

Dear [*FIRST-NAME*],

Thanks for submitting your abstract ([*TITLE*]) to SALT! The review process is well underway, and all reviews are due on Friday, January 22. This email is just a friendly reminder of the author response period, which will start Saturday, January 23 and end Friday, January 29. That is, your responses to the reviewer feedback will be due by 11:59 pm CST, January 29, 2016. Reviewers will then respond to this response by February 5, and the committee will finalize decisions by the end of February.

The purpose of the author and reviewer response periods is to enable constructive dialogue between authors and reviewers. Both author responses and further reviewer responses are optional. The program committee may refer to the dialogue to clarify their decisions, but in making program selections will give primary weight to the abstracts and the reviews.

Instructions on how to submit your response via EasyChair will accompany the review feedback, which we will make available to you on Saturday, January 23.

Happy New Year!

*Signature*
On behalf of the SALT organizing committee
