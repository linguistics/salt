Subject: SALT 26 Survey

Hello SALT 26 participants! This email is going out to all of this year's SALT's corresponding authors and registered participants. Sorry for the delay (it's been nearly two months since SALT took place) but we do hope you can spare **10 minutes** to tell us what you liked or didn't like about everything from the abstract review process, to lightning talks, to the conference party. Regardless of abstract outcome, and whether or not you attended the conference, _your feedback will help make SALT 27 (and beyond) even better_.

The survey is anonymous, and all questions are optional, so you can answer as much or as little as you like.

Thanks! Let us know if you have any questions,

On behalf of the SALT 26 organizing committee
