Subject: SALT 26 Publicity

Dear [*FIRST-NAME*],

I'd like to add your abstract to our website, linked from your entry on the program (http://salt.ling.utexas.edu/26/program), but I first want to give you a chance to touch it up and add a little information:

Most importantly, please prepend a single additional header page with the names of all authors, institutions, and a 100-250 word summary (an abstract of the abstract). If your paper had any self-identifying references masked / omitted to facilitate the anonymous review process, please de-anonymize those. Finally, feel free to make corrections or incorporate your reviewers' feedback, as long as the resulting document is not longer than five pages.

Please email the updated PDF, as a plain attachment with the filename "[*NUMBER*].pdf", to salt26conf@gmail.com with the subject line "Submission [*NUMBER*] abstract".

Alternatively, if you don't have any time to update your abstract, but still want it to be available on the website, simply send an email to salt26conf@gmail.com with the subject line "Submission [*NUMBER*] abstract release".

Thanks!

*Signature*
On behalf of the SALT organizing committee
