Dear [*FIRST-NAME*],

Congratulations! Your abstract ‘[*TITLE*]’ (submission ID: [*NUMBER*]) has been selected for presentation as a talk in the special session on presupposition at SALT 26. The special session will take place on Thursday May 12, 2016, with the main session (including posters from the special session) taking place May 13-15. We very much look forward to having your work on our program, and hope that you accept our invitation. Please let us know your decision by Friday, March 4, 2016, using this form:

After filling in that form, you will be directed to another page to provide further details to register for the conference, and then to another page to pay your registration fee (on Eventbrite). The direct links to these pages (which you can pass on to other potential attendees) are:

Registration details: http://goo.gl/forms/7Ed850YQzN

Registration fee: http://salt26.eventbrite.com
(Early registration at a reduced rate is available until April 15.)

We will offer a limited number of student scholarships, for which registration fees will be waived, and a stipend towards travel costs will be provided. These scholarships are intended for students who do not have independent sources of travel funding. Students giving presentations will have priority for scholarships.

This year, all poster presenters will give three-minute lightning talks prior to the poster session itself. Based on last year’s experience, the lightning talks will provide an effective way to acquaint everyone at the conference with your work prior to the more personal interactions of the poster session itself.

Presenting at SALT (as a poster or talk) also entitles you to publish a paper in the SALT 26 proceedings volume. You must present at the conference in order to publish in the proceedings.

Information about the conference is available at http://salt.ling.utexas.edu/26/

The reviews we received for your abstract are included below and are also available from the EasyChair reviewing site.

If you have any questions, please email us: salt26conf@gmail.com

We look forward to welcoming you at SALT 26 in May!

Sincerely,

*Signature*
On behalf of the SALT organizing committee
