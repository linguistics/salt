  <h3>Requirements</h3>

  <p>Abstracts must be anonymous and should be at most 3 pages (A4 or US Letter) in length, including examples, plus a separate page for references, using a 12pt font with 1 inch (2.5 cm) margins on all four sides. These limitations will be strictly enforced. In addition to the intellectual merit of the abstract, clarity and readability will also be taken into account in reviewing.</p>

  <p>SALT 26 will feature a poster session. The submission form asks that you indicate whether you would like your abstract to be considered for poster presentation. Poster presentations will be published as regular papers in the proceedings. Poster presenters will be asked to give a short &ldquo;lightning round&rdquo; presentation prior to the poster session.</p>

  <h3>Special Session on Presupposition</h3>

  <p>In addition to the regular sessions of SALT 26 there will be a one day special session on Presupposition, organized by Cleo Condoravdi (Stanford University) and Stefan Kaufmann (University of Connecticut). We are happy to announce three further invited speakers for this session:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~laurik/">Lauri Karttunen</a>, Stanford University</li>
    <li><a href="https://www-csli.stanford.edu/people/peters-stanley">Stanley Peters</a>, Stanford University</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~judith/">Judith Tonhauser</a>, The Ohio State University</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We encourage papers on any theoretical, experimental, fieldwork-based, or corpus approaches to presupposition, presupposition triggering, or presuppositional inference.</p>

  <p>The submission form asks that you indicate whether you would like your abstract to be considered for the Special Session on Presupposition or for the Main Session.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Policies</h3>

  <p>Authors may be involved in at most two abstracts and may be the sole author of at most one abstract.</p>

  <p>SALT does not accept papers that at the time of the conference have been published or have been accepted for publication. In addition, preference will be given to presentations that are not duplicated at other major conferences. We therefore request that authors indicate prior, pending, or planned presentations of their papers along with their contact information when they submit their abstracts.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Proceedings</h3>

  <p>All papers presented at the conference will be published in a SALT 26 volume following the conclusion of the conference, edited at Cornell University and published by the Linguistic Society of America.</p>
