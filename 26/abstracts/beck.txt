Scalar particles like English 'still' and its German counterpart
'noch' have a temporal continuative interpretation as in 'Tim is still
asleep'. But they have various other readings as well, which vary
somewhat between languages. This talk investigates in particular order
of mention readings of German 'noch' and other discourse related
readings as in 'I am still your mother.'An analysis in the spirit of
Krifka (2010) is proposed and its consequences explored.
