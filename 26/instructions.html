  <h2>Posters</h2>

  <b>Lightning talks</b>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>The lightning talks will proceed in the order listed on <a href="http://salt.ling.utexas.edu/26/program">the program</a>.</b>
      The order within a single session may change slightly before the conference, but who's in which session will not (barring any emergencies).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>You will have three minutes</b>, and this time limit will be strictly enforced. This is not very long, but keep in mind that the goal is just to give an overview of your poster and facilitate longer discussions during the poster session hour.
    </li>
    <li>
      Optionally, if you want to run through a few <b>slides</b> during your lightning talk (or just project your poster, verbatim) we will have a presentation device set up, and will combine all slides for each lightning talk session into a single presentation, prior to the conference. Any slides you want to show must be submitted:
      <ul>
        <li>before May 12, 2016</li>
        <li>to <a href="mailto:salt26conf@gmail.com">salt26conf@gmail.com</a></li>
        <li>using the subject line "SALT lightning talk slides"</li>
        <li>as a PDF attachment</li>
        <li>with the filename
          <code style="display: flex; align-items: center">
            <span class="punctuation-large">{</span><div>friday<br/>saturday</div><span class="punctuation-large">}</span>-
            <span class="punctuation-large">{</span><div>morning<br/>afternoon</div><span class="punctuation-large">}</span>-
            <span>{</span><i>first author's last name(s)</i>}.pdf
          </code> (without the curly braces!) e.g., <code>saturday-morning-brown.pdf</code>
          <br />
          <i>N.b.</i>, if you don't follow these instructions, your slides may end up in the wrong session!
        </li>
      </ul>
      Unless you specify otherwise in your email, these slides will (eventually) be made available on the website alongside your updated abstract PDF.
    </li>
    <li>
      We recommend that only one author gives the lightning talk, even if all authors are present.
    </li>
    <li>
      The moderator will indicate when your time is up, at which point you must stop and yield the stage to the next presenter.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <b>Poster layout</b>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Recommended size: 48 in. wide, 36 in. tall</b>
    </li>
    <li>
      Posters will be affixed to stands via binder clips (which we will provide).
      The vertical uprights are 72 in. apart, the top crossbar is around 80 in. off the ground, and the middle crossbar can be set to either 36 in. or 42 in. below the top crossbar.
      So technically your poster could be taller than 42 in., and just hang past the crossbar, but definitely no taller than 80 in.
      There's a example of the stand (in a different place / configuration) at the bottom of <a href="http://bit.ly/utstands">this page</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The stands will all be in place, but you are responsible for attaching your poster. A map on the SALT website will indicate where your poster should go (check back by May 12). Please attach your poster in its designated place during lunchtime on the day of your lightning talk, whether your lightning talk is in the morning or the afternoon.
    </li>
    <li>
      Please remove your poster before you leave the building at the end of the day.
      We expect to have some storage space in the Edgar A. Smith building if you want to bring your poster early or stash it for removal the following day.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you want to print your poster here in Austin, <a href="https://documentsolutions.utexas.edu/copycenters/contact">UT Copy Services</a> quoted me ~$72 for a 48"x36" color (b&w is the same price) poster (alternatively, ~$6 / ftÂ²), with 24-48 hour turn-around. They're only open Monday-Friday 8a-5p, so you would need to place your order before you arrive and pick it up Thursday or Friday. You can get in contact with them via phone: 512-471-1615, or email: <a href="mailto:utcopy@austin.utexas.edu">utcopy@austin.utexas.edu</a>.
